 <h1>Recipies - World's Best scrambled Eggs</h1>
 <p>I adopted this recipie from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger.Ever
   since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in
   Kings Cross,<br>Sydney. I have been after the recipie. I have since transformed
   it into what i really believe are the best scrambled eggs i have  ever tasted<br>
   <br>This recipie is what I call a "very special breakfast"; just look at the
   ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
